2.1 
Up to 3rd hiding units, Accuracy starts to increase gradually and when number of hiding units more than 3, it start to decrease the accuracy and after that accuracy rates becomes stable.
When the hiding units increases, the time taken for the execution starts to increase.

2.2
Accuracy Pattern:

Initial Increase: Accuracy improves as the number of hidden units increases from 1 to 5 hidden units.
Plateau: After 5 hidden units, accuracy stabilizes, showing little change as the number of hidden units increases further.
Diminishing Returns: Beyond 5 hidden units, adding more nodes (20, 50, 100) yields similar accuracy levels, indicating diminishing returns in performance improvement.
The accuracy increases significantly with more hidden units up to a point (around 5 hidden units), then levels off, suggesting that additional hidden nodes do not contribute much to improved performance.
